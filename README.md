Enthusiast of the best web and mobile development technologies.

Passionate about technology and always seeking the best to expand my knowledge.

"Nothing in this world beats good old-fashioned persistence. Talent doesn't overcome. Nothing is more common than talented failures. Genius doesn't overcome. Unrecognized geniuses are practically a clich√©. Education doesn't overcome. The world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination, in and of themselves, are powerful."
